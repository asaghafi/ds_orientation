# Data Scienc Orientation

I am sharing my material for Data Science Orientation course. My mentor, Dr. Chris P. Tsokos, believed in "Knowledge increases by sharing", that's my motto as well. Hope students and instrcutors in this field find these material useful and follow this trend so we all benefit. 

It took me some time to collect and organize the material. If you are an instructor, feel free to use the material in your course, please don't remove my name and credentials from the first slide, you may add yours. For students, dive in and share if you find the stuff useful. 

Have fun!
